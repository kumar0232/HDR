This project builds a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using CNN and SVM on the MNIST dataset. CNN extracts image features for high-accuracy digit prediction, while SVM acts as a baseline model. A web app lets users draw digits, process them, and get instant predictions in real time.

We focuses on developing an intelligent Handwritten Digit Recognition system that combines the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to accurately classify digits from the MNIST dataset. By leveraging CNN for automated feature extraction and SVM as a reliable comparative classifier, the system ensures high performance and improved prediction accuracy. A user-friendly web interface allows users to draw digits, which are then preprocessed and analyzed in real time. This project demonstrates practical machine learning integration, efficient model deployment, and the use of modern tools to create an interactive, scalable solution for digit recognition.
